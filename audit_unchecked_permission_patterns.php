// Pattern to look for: foreach with continue on !$enabled
echo "POTENTIAL ISSUES FOUND:\n\n";

echo "1. STORAGE MODULE:\n";
echo "   Code pattern: if (\$action === 'local') { /* add permission */ }\n";
echo "   Status: ✅ SAFE - Uses specific action check, not foreach with !enabled\n\n";

echo "2. AUTH MODULE:\n";
echo "   Code pattern: if (\$action === 'login') { /* add permission */ }\n";
echo "   Status: ✅ SAFE - Uses specific action check, not foreach with !enabled\n\n";

echo "3. SYSTEM MODULE (FIXED):\n";
echo "   Old: foreach (\$actions as \$action => \$enabled) { if (!\$enabled) continue; }\n";
echo "   New: \$dashboardEnabled = isset(\$actions['dashboard']) && (\$actions['dashboard'] == '1' || \$actions['dashboard'] === true);\n";
echo "   Status: ✅ FIXED - Now uses explicit isset() check\n\n";

echo "4. OTHER MODULES:\n";
echo "   Most other modules use pattern:\n";
echo "   foreach (\$actions as \$action => \$value) {\n";
echo "       if (\$value == '1' || \$value === true) {\n";
echo "           // Process permission\n";
echo "       }\n";
echo "   }\n";
echo "   Status: ✅ SAFE - Only processes when explicitly checked\n\n";

echo "5. ADMIN MODULE:\n";
echo "   Uses foreach with specific action checks inside\n";
echo "   Status: ✅ SAFE - No !enabled continue pattern\n\n";

echo "=== CONCLUSION ===\n";
echo "✅ SYSTEM MODULE: Fixed to handle unchecked dashboard properly\n";
echo "✅ OTHER MODULES: Already use safe patterns that handle unchecked correctly\n";
echo "✅ NO OTHER BUGS: Similar issues not found in other modules\n\n";

echo "=== THE ROOT CAUSE WAS UNIQUE TO SYSTEM MODULE ===\n";
echo "The system module was the only one using:\n";
echo "   foreach (\$actions as \$action => \$enabled) {\n";
echo "       if (!\$enabled) continue;  // This skipped unchecked items\n";
echo "\n";
echo "Other modules use safer patterns:\n";
echo "   if (\$value == '1' || \$value === true)  // Only process if explicitly checked\n\n";

echo "=== TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS ===\n";
echo "1. Test dashboard uncheck (FIXED)\n";
echo "2. Test other permissions uncheck (should work)\n";
echo "3. Test mixed scenarios (some checked, some unchecked)\n";
echo "4. Test edge cases (empty modules, no permissions)\n\n";

echo "=== VERIFICATION STEPS ===\n";
echo "1. Edit user with dashboard permission\n";
echo "2. Uncheck dashboard checkbox\n";
echo "3. Save user\n";
echo "4. Edit user again\n";
echo "5. Verify dashboard checkbox is unchecked (not checked again)\n";
echo "6. Verify user can't access /dashboard\n";
